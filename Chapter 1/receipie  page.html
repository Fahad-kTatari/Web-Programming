    <!-- Description -->
    <p>This recipe will guide you through making fluffy and tasty pancakes that everyone will love.</p>

    <!-- Ingredients -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Method -->
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; it's okay if the batter is a bit lumpy.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter or oil.</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake.</li>
        <li>Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake and the edges look set, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruits, or whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
